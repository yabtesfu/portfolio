Description of the Portfolio:
This is a personal portfolio website created as part of a web development course assignment. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and designed to be a clean, responsive, and interactive static website.

The portfolio includes three main pages:
1. **Home** – A landing page introducing who I am, featuring a typing animation, image transition, and social media links.
2. **About Me** – Contains educational background, contact information, current learning progress, and technical skills shown with animated progress bars and visual stickers.
3. **Projects** – Showcases three of my notable projects with descriptions, GitHub/live links, and project screenshots.

The website also includes:
- A working light/dark theme toggle with local storage support.
- Hover effects and smooth transitions.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile.
- Organized code structure with modern styling practices.

All code and assets are included in the project folder, and the website is designed to be submitted as a static site project.
